	<p style="text-align:Left;text-indent:0px;width:300px;">Andy Warhol was a successful magazine and ad illustrator who became a leading artist of the 1960s Pop art movements. He ventured into a wide variety of art forms, including performance art, filmmaking, video installations and writing and controversially blurred the lines between fine art and mainstream aesthetics. Warhol died on February 22, 1987, in New York City.</p>

	  <div id="paragraph2">
		<p style="text-align:Left;text-indent:0px;width:280px">Born Andrew Warhola on August 6, 1928, in the neighborhood of Oakland in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Warhol's parents were Slovakian immigrants. His father, Andrej Warhola, was a construction worker, while his mother, Julia Warhola, was an embroiderer. 
  
		  They were devout Byzantine Catholics who attended mass regularly and maintained much of their Slovakian culture and heritage while living in one of Pittsburgh's Eastern European ethnic enclaves.

       <div id="paragraph3">
	    <p style="text-align:Left;text-indent:0px;width:280px">At the age of eight, Warhol contracted Chorea—also known as St. Vitus's Dance — a rare and sometimes fatal disease of the nervous system that left him bedridden for several months. It was during these months, while Warhol was sick in bed, that his mother, herself a skillful artist, gave him his first drawing lessons.

        <div id="paragraph4">
     	<p style="text-align:Left;text-indent:0px;width:280px">Drawing soon became Warhol's favorite childhood pastime. He was also an avid fan of movies, and when his mother bought him a camera at the age of nine, he took up photography as well, developing film in a makeshift darkroom he set up in their basement.

			<p style="text-align:Left;text-indent:0px;width:300px;">Andy relocated to New York almost immediately after completing his degree in 1949. He started his career in advertising and magazine illustration. His ink drawings for various shoe advertisements received a lot of attention within New York’s advertising circles.

	  <div id="paragraph7">
			<p style="text-align:Left;text-indent:0px;width:300px;">The growing reputation of Andy Warhol caught the eyes of the music label ‘RCA Records.’ Andy and few other artists were hired by the music label to design the covers of the label’s albums. He was one of the very few artists to adopt the ‘Silk Screen’ printmaking process in the 1950s.

		  </div>
	  <div id="paragraph8">
			<p style="text-align:Left;text-indent:0px;width:300px;">Andy, who had earned enough money by 1960 through his advertisement commitments, purchased a four-storeyed building, so that he could experiment his art on the walls of the dwelling. He then came up with an unconventional style that helped him receive appreciation.
